DnD Character Randomizer
============
A fun program for D&D players. This is constantly under development and I am aware that the SSL Cert is invalid. This causes issues with some browsers and prevents http://dndcharacter.herokuapp.com/ from being accessible.

Running
------------
"python run.py" will start a local server on "localhost:33507" which will allow a local instance of the program to run.
